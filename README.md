# hardware-order-request-webform

A webform for employees to submit hardware order requests for approval or denial.  The backend of the webform should use AirTables api and webhooks to store the list of vendors available to order from and the unique products each vendor carries as well as pricing, ItemID, product notes, etc.  AirTable will package and send the full data package for each submission to make.com via webhook, where make.com will parse the JSON package and map the fields it contains to a the correct locations on a pdf template which will then be emailed for approval.
